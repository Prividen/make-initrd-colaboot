CoLaBoot (Compressed Layers Boot, CLB) is a boot system that mount rootfs as
OverlayFS from separate layers, each of them is a compressed squashfs image.


LAYERS
------------------------------------------
Layers can be aquired from network (HTTP(S)/FTP/TFTP/... any proto supported
by curl(1)), or from local filesystems (ISO/HDD). 

Multiple layer's locations are supported, and some of the layers may be
optional for boot.  Layers, which are placed on a local filesystems, can be
mounted directly, to avoid caching in memory.

All layers URIs, arranged by boot order, probably with some optional
parameters as well, should be listed in a text .manifest file, which URI
provided as the root= boot parameter.


MODULES
-----------------------------------------
CLB initrd image is designed to work with different kernels, so itself it
doesn't contain any modules at all. 

Kernel modules, required for boot, must be provided as a separate initramfs
image. These boot modules can be a drivers for network cards, disk devices,
file systems, etc.

Also this initramfs must contain modules, required by CLB itself: 
- squashfs,
- overlay, 
- af_packet (for dhcp client), 
- loop (if not compiled in kernel)

If there is no overlay module available for your kernel, CLB will just copy
content of SquashFS layers to tmpfs - the same effect, but increased memory
usage.

There are multiple module initramfs images can be used, e.g. you can temporary
provide a separate image with video modules for convenient debug environment.
If you need to have just one initrd blob, all used images can be concatenated
together (and may be with microcode image as well).

Any other modules for your system should be provided as a SquashFS layer(s),
or be embedded into the only layer that you have.


PERMANENT R/W LAYERS
-----------------------------------------
Normally CLB placed RW overlay layer in memory, but if you need to preserve
changes over reboot and have a permanent RW layer, it can be mounted from file
container ('file:' prefix, default, may be omitted), or as a file system on
the local disk device ('dev:' prefix).

Permanent RW layer can be specified in .manifest file:
PERM_RW=dev:///LABEL=my-filesystem
or as a boot parameter: clb_perm_rw=dev:///LABEL=my-filesystem

To use file container, create EXT4 image with appropriate size, put it on
local filesystem, and specify it's URI (absolute or relative to BASE) in
.manifest or as boot parameter (e.g.: clb_perm_rw=perm-rw.img).

To disable permanent RW layer temporary (without modify your .manifest), set
clb_stateless=1 boot parameter.


BOOT PARAMETERS
-----------------------------------------
root - URI of the .manifest file, OR of the only layer to boot. Examples:
root=http://my.boot.server/path/my.manifest
root=file:///sr0/isolinux/rootfs.squashfs
root=file:///LABEL=clb-iso/my.manifest

rootdelay - maximum delay in seconds for many wait actions, such as wait for
network address, or block device initialization. 

curlopts - any options for curl.

clb_fs_size - size for tmpfs. Default - 2G.

clb_use_iface - use specific network interface to boot.

clb_force_cache_images - if set to 0, will disable caching in memory of layers
images, accessible from local media (file:/// scheme in layer's URI).

clb_load_modules - comma separated list of kernel modules, required to be
loaded (we can't load modules, provided in separate initramfs images, via
standard make-initrd ways (like MODULES_PRELOAD))

clb_ip - static IP configuration as following: ifname:ip/prefix:gw:ns.
Example: clb_ip=eth0:10.0.0.12/24:10.0.0.1:8.8.8.8
Prefix can be network mask as well.

clb_perm_rw - permanent RW layer URI (see PERMANENT R/W LAYERS section)

clb_stateless - disable permanent RW layer (the only value is 1)

clb_macro_* - value for corresponding {BOOTOPT_*} macro.


MANIFEST OPTIONS
-----------------------------------------
BASE - the base path for all non-absolute URIs in this manifest.

LAYER - the squashfs layer URI. Can be absolute or relative to BASE. Multiple
locations is supported. If URI has 'OPTIONAL:' prefix, this layer considered
as optional - boot will be continued even if this layer is not available.

PERM_RW - URI of permanent RW layer (see PERMANENT R/W LAYERS section)

FORCE_CACHE_IMAGES - like a similar boot parameter, if set to 0, will disable
caching of layer images.


Also there are number of macros supported in .manifest file or for root=
boot parameter value. Macros are specified in curly brackets:

{inherit} - only for .manifest file. Expanded into 'dirname'-part of the
root's URI

{DHCP_*} - any DHCP variable which you can find in a dump file, making by
dhcpcd -U.  Examples: {DHCP_dhcp_server_identifier}, {DHCP_ip_address}

{BOOTOPT_*} - take value of corresponding clb_macro_* boot parameter. E.g.,
if you have a number of layers with modules for a different kernels, you can
specify in manifest file: LAYER=kernel-modules-{BOOTOPT_kernelver}.squashfs,
and boot your system with clb_macro_kernelver=3.10.0-862.14.4.el7.x86_64 boot
parameter.


BUILD YOUR INITRD WITH COLABOOT
-----------------------------------------
You can edit the sample config /etc/initrd.mk.d/colaboot.mk.example to fit your
requirements, and then run make-initrd: 
# make-initrd -c /etc/initrd.mk.d/colaboot.mk.example

Despite the fact you can see a kernel version in resulting initrd name, this image
contain no any kernel modules, which must be provided as a separate
initramfs image (please see 'MODULES' section).
